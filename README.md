About Me

Hi there! I'm Samuel HÃ¥llman, a third-year student on a mission to merge business and technology. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Business Information Technology with a specialization in data processing at LAB University of Applied Sciences in Lahti.

Academic Journey

In the dynamic world of web development, I've cultivated a robust foundation, navigating the realms of JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, C#, C++, Java, and MySQL. My coursework supports my hands-on experience as a team leader, steering a school project to create two games for children using JavaScript and TypeScript. This endeavor not only fine-tuned my coding skills but also imparted invaluable insights into project management and leadership dynamics.

Core Skills

 Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, C++, Java 
 Frameworks: React, Angular

Project Portfolio

Dive into my world of coding and creativity through my portfolio, a showcase of projects developed over the past year. Crafted with React and TypeScript, this endeavor challenged me to explore the intricacies of CSS, TypeScript, and the essential elements of a website. From animations to the effective utilization of props and hooks in HTML text, I've delved deep into the art of web development.

Education and Experience

My journey has been diverseâ€”I transitioned from being a non-commissioned officer in the army, where I honed skills in team leadership and effective communication. These skills seamlessly translated into my studies, where I'm laser-focused on data processing with a keen interest in website creation. As I tread the path of continuous learning, I'm eager to contribute my skills to real-world projects and innovate in the ever-evolving web development landscape.
